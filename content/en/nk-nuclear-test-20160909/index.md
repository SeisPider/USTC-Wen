  Based on the similarity of the seismic data between 9 September 2016 event and North Korea's previous nuclear tests, we confirm that 9 September 2016 event is a nuclear test in nature. We have determined that North Korea's 9 September 2016 nuclear test occurred at 00:30:01.366 UTC, (9:00:01.366 local time), 9 September 2016, at the location of (41°17'54.60''N, 129°4'40.80''E), with an estimated yield of 17.8±5.9 kt. The geographic precision of the location determination is 110 m. North Korea's 9 September 2016 test and its three previous tests (2016/01/06, 2013/02/12 and 2009/05/25) are located several hundred meters apart, beneath a same mountain. The estimated yield of 9 September 2016 test is higher than that of its previous tests (11.3±4.2 kt for 2016/01/06 test, 12.2±3.8 kt for 2013/02/12 test, and 7.0±1.9 kt for 2009/05/25 test). Figure 1 shows the determined location and yield of North Korea's 9 September 2016 nuclear test, along with the locations and yields of its previous tests.

North Korea's 9 September 2016 nuclear test site is pinpointed by deriving relative location of North Korea's 2016/09/09 and 2009/05/25 nuclear tests and using the previously determined location of the 2009 nuclear test, while its yield is estimated based on the relative amplitude ratios of the Lg waves recorded for both events, the previously determined Lg-magnitude of 2009 nuclear test and burial depth inferred from satellite imagery. Figure 2 shows the seismic stations and seismic data used to relocate the nuclear test. The seismic data come from a seismic station in China (MDJ) of the Global Seismographic Network, jointly operated by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology and China Earthquake Administration and some seismic stations in China and Japan.
