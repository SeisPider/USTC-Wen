Based on the similarity of the seismic data between 3 September 2017 event and
North Korea's previous nuclear tests, we confirm that 3 September 2017 event
is a nuclear test in nature. We have determined that North Korea's 3 September
2017 nuclear test occurred at UTC 2017/09/03 03:30, (2017/09/03 12:00 local time),
at the location of (41°17'53.52''N, 129°4'27.12''E), with an estimated yield of
108.3±48.1 kt. The geographic precision of the location determination is 100 m.
North Korea's 3 September 2017 test and its four previous tests
(2016/09/09, 2016/01/06, 2013/02/12 and 2009/05/25) are located several hundred
meters apart, beneath a same mountain. The estimated yield of 3 September 2017
test is higher than that of its previous tests (17.8±5.9 kt for 2016/09/09,
11.3±4.2 kt for 2016/01/06 test, 12.2±3.8 kt for 2013/02/12 test, and 7.0±1.9 kt
for 2009/05/25 test). Figure 1 shows the determined location and yield of North
Korea's 3 September 2017 nuclear test, along with the locations and yields of
its previous tests.

North Korea's 3 September 2017 nuclear test site is pinpointed by deriving
relative location of North Korea's 2017/09/03 and 2016/09/09 nuclear tests and
using the previously determined location of the 2016 nuclear test, while its
yield is estimated based on the relative amplitude ratios of the Lg waves
recorded in 112 seismic stations of the Chinese regional networks, the previously
determined Lg-magnitude of 2016 nuclear test and burial depth inferred from
satellite imagery. Figure 2 shows the seismic stations and seismic data used to
relocate the nuclear test. The seismic data come from a seismic station in China (MDJ)
of the Global Seismographic Network, jointly operated by the Incorporated Research
Institutions for Seismology and China Earthquake Administration and some seismic
stations in China and Japan.
