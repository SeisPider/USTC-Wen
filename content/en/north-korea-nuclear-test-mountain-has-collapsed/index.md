Mount Mantap, which hosted all of the North Korea's nuclear tests since
2009, has collapsed after North Korea's 3 September 2017 nuclear test,
reported by researchers at the University of Science and Technology of
China (USTC) and Stony Brook University (SBU) in a study published in a
top geophysical journal *Geophysical Research Letters* of the American
Geophysical Union. The study also clarifies the nature of three small
seismic events after 23 September 2017 as a natural earthquake swarm
outside Mount Mantap, triggered by the 2017 nuclear test.

On 3 September 2017, North Korea announced that it had successfully
conducted a thermonuclear (hydrogen bomb) test. Unlike previous nuclear
tests, the 2017 nuclear test was followed by several small but important
seismic events, with one eight-and-a-half minutes after the test, two on
23 September 2017 and one on 12 October 2017. While there have been
intense interests and concerns about what has happened after the nuclear
test among the scientific community, governmental agencies and the
public, the nature of these seismic events remains unknown. The USTC/SBU
study, which was based on the analysis of the seismic data recorded at
1972 stations worldwide, has determined that the first event occurring
eight-and-a-half minutes after the test is a near vertical on-site
collapse toward the nuclear test center from 440 m northwest of the test
site, and the later three events after 23 September 2017 are an
earthquake swarm located 8.4 km north of the test site within a region
of 520 m, with a focal depth of at least 2.4 km.

The occurrence of the on-site collapse calls for continued monitoring of
any possible leaks of radioactive materials from the test site.
