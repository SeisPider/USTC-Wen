This package is the source code for a new developed high-resolutionrelocation method (named hypoRelocate). HypoRelocate utilizes traditional constraints of absolute travel time and differentialtravel time, and one new constraint of coda cross-correlograms between the events. The relocation is performed by using a simulated annealing method to search for the best-fitting locations and origin times of the events that minimize the total residual of the all above three constriants of the events. HypoRelocate expands the advantage of using differential constraints to better determine high-resolution relative locations between the events b constructing constraint of coda cross-correlograms on inter-event distance, and reduces the dependence of relocation results on the accuracy of the initial catalog by incorporating the absolute time into the joint inversion.
