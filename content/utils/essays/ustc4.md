When I was young, all elders around me told me, “You guys must take earnestly on study and be admitted to Tsinghua University (THU) or Peking University (PKU)”. Maybe in their minds, THU and PKU were regarded as the symbol of higher education. However, most of them had never even been to Beijing, but why were they so sure of it? When I considered the problem, the meaning of higher education became gradually dim.

　  During the past twenty years, I ensured that this sentence enjoyed the highest frequency in my ears, “Study well and make progress every day, then you will earn a lot of money when you grow up”. Can I speak that professional skills and great treatment are the only purpose of higher education? Maybe it is a common view in modern society. Most of students are expected to go to university because it is helpful to find a stable job. This view should not be blamed harshly, but Lan Xiang or New Oriental might be a better choice for them.

　  So what is higher education?

　  “Rare voice of big sound, elephant invisible”, the answer is implied in the saying of Lao Tzu. The progress made by higher education can’t be touched, and we probably end up living bland lives, even though we once proudly say that “I have received higher education”. Even so, higher education is still regarded as a holy thing, and the importance of higher education surpasses money, especially in developed countries.

　  Higher education exerts an imperceptible influence on people’s thinking. If a quantitative result must be given, it’s so easy! The ability to think independently, and it has every reason to become a part of higher education. Once I fantasied that the world is black and white, and others’ ideas and the knowledge in textbooks were always treated as bible, but the higher education has taught me that we must have a critical mind about anything so that we’ll be ourselves. So the ability of independent thinking occupies 30% of higher education.

　  In addition, the undergraduate experience will move students from competence to commitment. The transition from competence to commitment is the original intention, and it ought to be the most significant part of higher education, because the transition guarantees the inheritance of education. It is generally recognized that the quality of undergraduate education is hard to measure, but the initiative of graduates who participate in social activities should be a reference index. When it comes to the transition from competence to commitment, the blog “SeisMan” is the best example. So I generously give the transition 50 percentage.

　  For the rest 20%, I think that it should be defined by ourselves. After all, the meaning of higher education varies from person to person, so we have the right to keep the view of it. Maybe the rest part is professional knowledge、logical thinking or programming capabilities. Follow your heart, and you will enjoy your own higher education.
