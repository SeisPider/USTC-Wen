　  Higher education is a filtrating of quasi-elites for high school students, a higher platform for college students, and a delivery room of the elites of a society.

　  The good educational resources in a country are finite, and impossible to be shared by everyone. The higher education essentially is a filter selecting talented high school students meeting requirements, make it more efficient to train future elites of our society.

　  For college students being under higher education, it means a higher platform in their life stages. It is like a club gathering talented, open-minded, progressive people. Education is a progressive discovery of ignorance. Through communications and discussions they find the shortcomings of themselves, and learn from others. A smart brain can only become smarter among other smart brains, otherwise it would fall to be mediocre if stay with ordinary brains.

　  This platform is also an important place to make connections with future elites. Building and sustaining mutually beneficial relationships benefits future career after graduation. Good education environments provide more opportunities to build advanced connections, with ones from different social classes.

　  Higher education also provides a platform, with free space and time for young, fresh men to try and error, to find and discover their life goals. When in my last year of college, I got a chance to become a teaching assistant in a specialized course, and finally found my talents in teaching and lecturing. From the experience as a teaching assistant, I gained much achievability when training and teaching young brains. Many famous people start their enterprises in their periods of higher education. The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, launched his Facebook in Harvard from a small website that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. Without higher education, it is hard for young men to get time and resources to try their ideas.

　  Higher education also means teaching more skills and knowledge of discovering and researching in unknown fields, instead of focusing on textbook like high school stage. The goal of higher education is culturing future elites, leading advancements for our society, which needs raising creativities and innovations in young brains. Pioneers never come from repeating predecessors’ works. During my college stage, I found the courses focus too much on knowledge in textbooks and problem sets. Indeed, the basic knowledge is very important, but the university should not ignore the culturing of researching skills. Many students do not know how to search a literature in database, even google scholar. The evaluation system is too simple to reflect real abilities: some students can get good grades in C language exams, but could not code the required programs in practice. This kind of higher education is not successful education.

　  Higher platform for college students, and a delivery room for future elites ---- that is what higher education means in my opinion. Higher education is the most important stage in people’s life, and is essential to success in future careers.
