title: USA essay 6
---

The second chance colloquially called college
The ability for those with no homeland
Finally to be surrounded by acres of known
To find their place of origin, unbeknownst to others

A common meeting ground for scholars
Where the goal of being wise is within reach
A place of growth and realization of aspirations
Or simply, a new home

Wanderers from across the globe
Pack their bags once more
Preparing for the next decade of change
For the time to discover is upon them

They will see the next generation of thinkers
Whose legacies live on
Shake hands with self-made dreamers
Who our textbooks overlook

Higher education bestows them the chance
To find new kin
Who see the world as they do
And want to change it like they do

And for that these orphans of society
Become children of books
Heirs of wisdom
And college students

　　　　  Sincerely,
The Educated Vagrant
