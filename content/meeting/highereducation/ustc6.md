When I was in my junior high and senior high, I was told many times that the six years in high school is the most important part of life for everyone. In this period, we studied hard and tried to obtain desired results in the college entrance examinations. And free university life awaits us after that.

　  It seems that in China, love and video games have become the themes of college life, and we seem to enjoy the precious ‘freedom’ after the college entrance examination with peace of mind. When we go to work from college, we may have even forgotten what we learned in college and why we received higher education.

　  What is higher education? I think it’s not only a stage or subtype of education but also more than just education.

　  First of all, higher education is an opportunity for us to learn systematically and optimize our studying methods. We face steeply increase in both difficulty and number of courses in college, compared to those in high school days. So it’s important for us to adjust to such explosive growth of knowledge and we have to learn to receive knowledge in some more effective ways.

　  Secondly, higher education means a challenge for our self-control abilities, because in college we are no longer supervised by teachers and parents as we did in high school. We have to force ourselves to go to class, do homework and study. We should learn to arrange our time in learning and resist temptations from a variety of ball games and computer games, and pass all the exams.

　  Thirdly, higher education is a chance of enhancement of our body, practical ability and experience, rather than the acquisition of knowledge only. During the period of higher education, we should exercise to keep healthy. Participation in social activities in campus and Social practice is also necessary for us to gain practical ability and experience and service consciousness.

　  Last but not least, in my opinion, we try to learn why we learn during the period of higher education. In high school, we studied Physics and read Lu Xun’s articles, yet we were never told or asked why we learn these. Higher education also has the responsibility to us understanding why we learn them. By higher education, we gradually understand that we study physics to cultivate our spirit of seeking truth from facts; we read Lu Xun’s article, to understand the poverty and hardships of the people in the old times, so as to cherish our lives with hard-earned freedom.

　  What is higher education? In a nutshell, it is a period that we learn how to learn and why we learn, and a period in which we turn from muddled high school graduates, into sturdy adults with moral integrity and knowledge.
