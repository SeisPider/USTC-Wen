This essay seems like a review of my college life in which all things seemed to be colorful and wonderful. These feels come from several experiences provided by higher education.

　  On the one hand, higher education brings us multiple ways to explore ourselves.

　  After my 18th birthday, I came into my college life with curiosity and planned to explore as many interesting things as possible to find my identity. Thus, I tried my best to play significant roles in student association and to improve the public speaking skills by joining debate competitions, which taught mecritical thinking and precise expression in debate. For one thing, to improve leading ability, I created a student union association combined by students who majored in geophysics. Naturally, I played a critical role in this association. Happily, we successfully organized a graduation party and a study communication salon. However, during these activities, I gradually found it tiring to communicate with many people at the same time. For another, to enhance ability to speak in public, I joined some debates. However,after several competitions, lack of training time and slow-speed way of speaking gradually limited me. Thus, except for debate, I particularly trained speech ability and speaking speed by joining speech contest. Nevertheless, I gradually knew more about myself and was aware of that communication and managementmay not be my natural gift.

　  My personal experiences illustrate that higher education can help us know ourselves better by providing many possibilities to experience multiple roles.

　  On the other hand, higher education can also help us explore the external world.

　  During my college life, many distinguished teachers led me to the way to knowledge about universe, life, philosophy and so on. Some teachers showed me beautiful and astonishing universe. Some of them taught me how to think like a philosopher. Furthermore, some teachers brought me into colorful world of life. In university, I could always take classes about whatever I was interested in and there were always some teachers who could share their knowledge with me.

　  In one word, teachers brought me multiple ways to explore the world, which greatly broadened my eyes.

　  In conclusion, the higher education seems like a train on which you can discover the world and yourself. During this trip, you could find what you do like. As for me, during this discovery trip, I gradually knew some disadvantages of myself, such as the lack of passion in speaking, the lack of self-control and so on. In another aspect, I was interested in earth science and firmly decided to further study on earth science. I made this choice based on various experiences in college life. Additionally, explorations in these yearsbrought me happiness for several successes and depression for some awful failures, which all trained me much in psychological endurance. I think exploration is the essence of higher education.
